Developing a diabetes prediction system using machine learning:

My learning journey of building a Diabetes prediction system with ML.

Embarking on this journey create a Diabetes Prediction System has been an incredible learning experience .Here are few insights I 've gained:

Accuracy and precision is most used criteria for Selection projects. So I have used . I have used CatBoost model is best for my model. 

Hyperparameter optimization is the process of finding the best set of hyperparameters for my  machine learning model.

I have also examine the success of our optimized CatBoost model.

Then I have plot_confusion_matrix, visualizes the relationship between the actual labels (y) and the predicted labels (y_predict) using a heatmap representation of the confusion matrix. It calculates the accuracy score between the actual and predicted labels and displays it on top of the confusion matrix. This visualization helps understand how well the model performs in classifying each label and which classes are misclassified.

And I have achieved  accuracy score = 0.89.
